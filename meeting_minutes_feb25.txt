The library down the road is quiet today. Only a few people are inside, reading books or working on laptops. The shelves are full of colorful book covers, and there’s a small table with free coffee. I picked up a mystery novel to read later. It’s a peaceful place to spend the afternoon.

Last weekend, I planted some flowers in the backyard. I dug holes in the soil and put in seeds for sunflowers and daisies. The ground was soft from recent rain, which made it easy. Now, I water them every morning and check for sprouts. I hope they grow tall by summer.

A stray cat keeps visiting my porch. It’s orange with white patches and sits by the door every evening. I started leaving out a bowl of water, and it drinks from it. Yesterday, it let me pet it for the first time. I might give it a name if it keeps coming back.

The grocery store was busy this morning. I went to buy milk, eggs, and bread, but the aisles were crowded. Someone dropped a jar of sauce, and it broke on the floor. The staff cleaned it up quickly. I waited in line for ten minutes before checking out.

My neighbor built a birdhouse out of wood. He painted it blue and hung it on a tree in his yard. Small birds started visiting it within a day. I saw one carrying twigs to make a nest inside. He said he’s going to build another one next week.
